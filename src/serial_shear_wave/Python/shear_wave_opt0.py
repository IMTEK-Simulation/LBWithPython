This is an implementation of the D2Q9 Lattice Boltzmann lattice in the simple
relaxation time approximation. The code reports the amplitude of a decaying
shear wave which can be used to measure viscosity.

The present implementation contains no optimizations but was developed to
yield a concise code. Storage order was chosen such that the indices of
locations on the 2D real-space grid are the fast indices.

### Parameters

# Lattice
nx = 300
ny = 300

# Number of steps
nsteps = 1000

# Relaxation parameter
omega = 0.3

### Auxiliary arrays

# Naming conventions for arrays: Subscript indicates type of dimension
# Example: c_ic <- 2-dimensional array
#            ^^
#            ||--- c: Cartesian index, can have value 0 or 1
#            |---- i: Channel index, can have value 0 to 8
# Example: f_ikl <- 3-dimensional array
#            ^^^
#            |||--- l: y-position, can have value 0 to ny-1
#            ||---- k: x-position, can have value 0 to nx-1
#            |----- i: Channel index, can value 0 to 8

# "Velocities" of individual channels

                 [0,  0,  1,  0, -1,  1,  1, -1, -1]]).T # velocities, y components
